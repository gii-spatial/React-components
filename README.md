# ⚛️ React-components

Welcome to **React-components**  
My personal stash of handy, reusable React components!

This repo is all about storing lightweight React components I use across projects. Instead of building the same UI elements over and over, I keep these components here as a boilerplate to easily grab whenever I need them.

>### ⚠️ Note:  
>These components were created with the following version of react:
>- React: v19.1.0+  

---

### 👩‍💻 How to use
 1. Pick the component file/folder you want
 2. Import it into your React project
 3. Install dependencies (if necessary)
 4. Use it like any other React component  

---

### 🔄 Reusability

Want to reuse a component?  
Just copy the file or the entire folder you need into your project — simple as that! No complicated installs or dependencies unless noted below.

---

### 📦 Dependencies

If a component relies on relative dependencies (like helper functions or shared utils), or third-party npm packages, make sure to copy those files too, and install any required npm packages as mentioned in the component’s notes.

Created with ❤️ for React devs who love clean and reusable code  
Happy coding! 🚀✨
